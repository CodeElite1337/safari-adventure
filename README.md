My Safari Adventure Tour Website Project
Hey there! üëã Welcome to the README file for my very first beginner project ‚Äì the Safari Adventure Tour Website. I'm so excited to share what I've learned and built throughout this journey.

Introduction
This project is my first step into the world of web development. I wanted to create a simple website to showcase the thrill of safari adventure tours. Through this project, I've tried to capture the essence of safari experiences and present it through three main pages: the Landing Page, Gallery, and Signup Page.

What I've Learned
Throughout the process of building this project, I've learned a lot of new things:

HTML: I've used HTML to structure the content of each page. It's amazing how just a few tags can create a whole web page!

CSS: Styling was a big challenge, but I've used CSS to make the website visually appealing. I learned about selecting elements, applying styles, and even making the website responsive for different devices.

Navigation: Creating a navigation menu that stays consistent across all pages was a cool discovery. I've learned how to link different pages together.

Images: Incorporating images into the project was fun. I found out how to set background images and create a gallery of pictures.

Forms: Building a simple form on the Signup Page was a great experience. I now understand how to gather user input and send it to a server.

Pages
Landing Page
The Landing Page is where the adventure begins! It features:

A navigation menu that guides users to different parts of the website.
Engaging background images that instantly transport visitors into the safari world.
A catchy headline introducing the excitement of safari adventure tours.
Short descriptions highlighting the key features of the tours.
Buttons that invite users to dive deeper into the experience.
Gallery
The Gallery Page is like a photo album full of stunning safari images. It includes:

A navigation menu for easy navigation across the pages.
An organized grid layout displaying images with captions.
A design that adjusts to various screen sizes, making the experience enjoyable on all devices.
Signup Page
The Signup Page is where users can express their interest in joining the safari tours. It includes:

A navigation menu for seamless exploration.
A user-friendly form with fields for name, email, preferred tour dates, and number of participants.
A submit button to send the form data for processing.

Navigate to the project folder: cd safari-adventure
Open any web browser and launch the index.html file.
Future Steps
While I'm proud of what I've accomplished with this project, I know there's always room for improvement. In the future, I'd like to:

Add more pages to the website, such as an About Us and Contact page.
Enhance the styling to make the website even more engaging.
Dive deeper into backend development to make the signup form functional.
